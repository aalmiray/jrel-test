description: |
JReleaser is a release automation tool for Java projects. Its goal is to simplify creating releases
and publishing artifacts to multiple package managers while providing customizable options.

JReleaser takes inputs from popular builds tools (Ant, Maven, Gradle) such as JAR files, binary
distributions (.zip, .tar), JLink images, or any other file that youâ€™d like to publish as a Git
release on popular Git services such as Github or Gitlab. Distribution files can additionally be
published to be consumed by popular package managers as Homebrew, Snapcraft, or get ready to be
launched via Jbang. Releases may be announced in a variety of channels such as Twitter, Zulip, or SDKMAN!
